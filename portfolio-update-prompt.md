# Portfolio Update — Prompt for Claude Code

## Context

I'm updating my personal developer portfolio website. The site is built with Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Firebase Hosting at https://andrea-lopez-palomeque.web.app/

**Important:** This is a content and text update — do NOT redesign the site or change its layout/structure/styling. Only update text, dates, descriptions, project entries, and tag lists. Keep the existing design intact.

---

## WHO I AM (use this to rewrite my intro/description)

My name is Andrea Victoria López Palomeque. I'm a frontend developer from Argentina (based in Buenos Aires) with 43 years of professional experience. I've worked exclusively in startup environments — small teams moving fast, wearing multiple hats, shipping products to real users. I'm used to adapting quickly, learning new technologies on the job, and collaborating closely with designers, backend engineers, and founders.

My core strength is building clean, performant, accessible UIs. I care about component architecture, user experience, and shipping things that actually work well. I'm currently expanding into backend development (Node.js/Express/Firebase) through my side projects, and I'm starting a Software Engineering degree in March 2026 because I want deeper foundations in architecture, algorithms, and systems design.

I'm comfortable in English (C2) and Spanish (native). I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations.

**Tone for the description:** Confident but not arrogant. Direct. Show personality — I'm someone who builds things, solves real problems, and keeps learning. Avoid buzzwords. Keep it 2-3 sentences max.

## Before making changes:
1. Read through the full codebase to understand the project structure
2. Identify where the content/text lives (likely in Vue components, pages, or a data file)
3. Show me a plan of which files you'll modify before making changes
4. Make changes one section at a time so I can review
